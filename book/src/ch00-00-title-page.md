# The Manatee Game Engine

*by James Kienle, inspired by The Rust Book by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols*

This book is currently a living document and is **heavily** subject to change. Once a first, stable
version of Manatee is released, this book will be versioned identically to the engine itself and
packaged alongside it.
