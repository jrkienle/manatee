# Introduction

Welcome to The Manatee Game Engine, a book about building games using Manatee. The Manatee Game
Engine is a set of tools to help you build amazing, optimized, and performant video games, without
sacrificing developer experience. Manatee is built using the Zig programming language, making it a
perfect fit for either starting a brand new project or leveling up an existing C/C++ game.

## Who Manatee is For

Right now Manatee is built just for myself (James Kienle), however in the future I'm hoping that
Manatee will be usable for many more. My dream is that Manatee will one day be used by

* Game Design and Computer Science Students
* Indie Developers / Hackers
* Artists with Amazing Ideas
* Game Studios from Indie to AAA

## Who This Book is For

This book assumes two things

1. You have a moderate understanding of how to use a computer (managing your files, installing
   software, running basic commands, etc.)
2. You've played video games before and want to build one

This book assumes no prior programming or game design knowledge (however it's super helpful to
have) and is meant to be as broadly accessible as possible to a wide variety of backgrounds. I had
no knowledge of game design before building Manatee, and I believe that if I could build this, than
anyone should be able to use it!

With all of that being said, it would be incredibly helpful to learn a few things before going too
deep with learning Manatee. These things include:

1. Git. FreeCodeCamp has an **amazing**
   [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/) for beginners.
2. Zig. Zig is the programming language that Manatee is written in, and you'll need to learn it in
   order to build games with Manatee. Unfortunately Zig's documentation is lacking in places, but
   this book tries to compensate for that where it can. The [Zig Guide](https://zig.guide/) can be
   a helpful resource for those new to Zig.
3. A little bit of game design theory. Elvtr has a really nice
   [article](https://elvtr.com/blog/the-fundamentals-of-game-design) going over some of the 
   fundamentals.

## How to Use This Book

This book is best used by reading it, either with your eyeballs or with a screen reader if you have
any sight-related disabilities (maybe one day I'll pay someone to record a dramatic, full-cast
audio book for this, accepting volunteers!). In all seriousness, use this book however you want.
It's written to be read front to back, but feel free to pop into whatever chapter you want and grab
the information you need.
